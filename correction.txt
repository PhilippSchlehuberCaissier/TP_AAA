# Automata guessing:
Can be determined on finite
1) a xor Xb resp. (a & X!b) | (!a & Xb)
Is infinite
2) G((X(a ->Xb))) resp XG(!a | Xb)

# Lift model
A useful feature for an elevator is to got to the desired floor
for all 0 <= i < 4
'G("req[i]" -> F("p==i" && "cabin.open"))'
This could be refined by demanding that he only changes
dircection if necessary or only stops when demanded
