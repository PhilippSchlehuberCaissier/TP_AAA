Incompatibility issue with jupyterlab

By default, mybinder launches jupyterlab instead of the "traditional"
jupyter notebook.
However jupyterlab is currently incompatible with how we display parts
of the third exercice (And possibly entrails other problems as well).

To remedy this problem follow these steps:

1) Launch your own binder by connecting to
https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/PhilippSchlehuberCaissier/TP_AAA/docker

2) This should redirect you to something like
https://hub.gke2.mybinder.org/user/philippschlehubercaissier-tp_aaa-xil1brzx/lab
note that the first part (hub.gke2) as well as the last part (xil1brzx)
may be different for you.

3) Replace the ending /lab by /tree. This should still show you all the files
but in a different GUI. For me:
https://hub.gke2.mybinder.org/user/philippschlehubercaissier-tp_aaa-xil1brzx/tree

4) Enjoy
